              The hardware project course was one of the best learning experiences I've had. We worked on a project from start to finish, which involved research, design, prototyping, and testing. The instructors were knowledgeable and supportive, and they challenged us to think creatively and critically. I feel much more comfortable working with electronics after completing this course, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in hardware design.

              Participating in the project competition was one of the highlights of my academic career. It was a great opportunity to apply what I had learned in class to a real-world project. I enjoyed the challenge of working on a team and coming up with a creative solution to the problem. The competition was well-organized, and the judges provided valuable feedback that helped us improve our project.
